If you encounter a @NullPointerException@ while using the OAuth2 plugin, you might have run into [GPCACHE-25|https://jira.grails.org/browse/GPCACHE-25]. This will occur when using the OAuth2 plugin with earlier versions of the [Cache Plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/cache]. However, the latest version at the time of this writing (@1.1.6@) seems to have fixed this issue. To resolve the @NullPointerException@ issue, either upgrade the Cache plugin or uninstall it.

If an instance of one of the GORM backed classes that the plugin uses cannot be saved, an @OAuth2ValidationException@ will be thrown. This is a subclass of the standard Grails @ValidationException@ so the plugin consumer has the flexibility to determine how to deal with this type of error. The typical reason for this exception being thrown will likely be related to the max size allotted to the serialized @OAuth2Authentication@ fields. The thrown exception can be inspected for further information about the @Errors@.
